The aim of this project was to build a home security system with elements of home automation that can be remotely controlled using a mobile application. All this so that the system user can remotely control household appliances, such as heating or lighting as needed. However, the most important element of the project is a silent alarm that triggers when motion is detected. This movement may suggest breaking in and in this case the reaction time is a key element in the fight against this phenomenon.
