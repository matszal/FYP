Preparing my machine to install Tomcat and start ramping up about servlets, HTML, session etc.

Successfully installed tomcat on my local machine and enabled default settings. Gained access to the gui manager. I followed the instructions from this linkhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-8-on-ubuntu-16-04 now I will look into encrypting my SSL connections and servlets + HTML
